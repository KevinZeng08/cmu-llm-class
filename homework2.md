# Preparation: Setting up AWS

To complete this homework, you will need access to GPU resources for training models.

The TAs have compiled step-by-step setup instructions with screenshots here: [AWS setup guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tw_klO84R9G7CZ3cINAKgy4BfdNm-8dlnRXSBIVD_3A/edit?usp=sharing)

**Note: Question 1, Question 2.1-4 and Question 3.1 can be done without GPU access. We suggest that you start the assignment early while waiting for AWS credits.**

# Submission

You should prepare a zip file named `[andrew-id].zip` that contains the following files:
- `model.py`
- `train.py`
- `generate.py`
- `classify.py`
- `model.pt` (weights from your trained model in Question 2.6)
- a pdf file `[andrew-id].pdf` with answers to the written questions

We will soon update this page with instructions on where to submit the assignment.
