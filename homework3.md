# Submission

For homework 3, we will be using **Gradescope**. Please use the link from the Canvas coursepage.  
Two assignments will be created on Gradescope: `Homework 3 - PDF` and `Homework 3 - Code`.  

As Gradescope cannot handle large files, please submit your model checkpoints and dataset file through Canvas at the `Homework 3 -- Models and Data` link.

`Homework 3 - PDF` will be manually graded by the instructors.  
Please submit your a pdf file `[andrew-id].pdf` with answers to the written questions, and annotate the locations of each question's solution in your PDF.

`Homework 3 - Code` contains an autograder that will grade your code with the same unit tests provided in the homework.  
Please submit all code you used in the assignment, including code to train and decode from your model.
